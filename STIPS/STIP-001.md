# **STIP-001 : Aave Leverage Module**

**_Using template v0.1_**


## Abstract

Our suite of trustless leverage products based on Compound, ETH2x-FLI and WBTC2x-FLI, have exceeded our expectations and are our most profitable products. However, Compound does not support other high volume ERC20 tokens such as LINK, YFI, DPI etc. Also, the cost of maintenance of FLI products has been on a rise due to the high gas costs on the Ethereum blockchain, and we need to move towards enabling products on layer 2 scaling solutions, to decrease these costs for our third-party managers.


## Motivation


#### Feature

A module which interacts with Aave, another lending protocol similar to Compound, would allow us to launch more leverage products and support assets which are not available on Compound.


#### Why is this feature necessary?

1. To launch the LINK 2x which is only available on Aave. LINK has over $1B in liquidity and is the most traded ERC20 token higher than UNI, MATIC etc.
2. To enable third party Set managers to margin trade using Aave.
3. To deploy on Matic L2 and enable MATIC2x token.


#### Who is this feature for and how is it intended to be used?

This feature is for managers and product developers. It enables launching leverage products like ETH2x-FLI using assets on Aave markets. It also enables third party managers to add leverage positions in their SetToken.



## Background Information


### Set System / Previous Work



*   CompoundLeverageModule
    *   Sync positions in module hooks
    *   Entering markets to enable collateral
    *   Lever interface: borrow -> trade -> mint
    *   Delever interface: redeem -> trade -> repay
*   Compound External Library
    *   An external library that houses all the Compound external interactions


### Aave Research


#### [Docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/the-core-protocol/lendingpool/ilendingpool)


#### LendingPoolAddressProvider



*   `function getLendingPool() external view returns (address)`
    *   LendingPool address should be fetched from the LendingPoolAddressesProvider as contract addresses could change in Aave


#### LendingPool

The main entry point into the Aave Protocol. Most interactions with Aave will happen via the LendingPool.



*   `function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode) external`
    *   Deposits an `amount` of underlying asset into the reserve, receiving in return overlying aTokens.
*   `function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) external returns (uint256)`
    *   Withdraws an `amount` of underlying asset from the reserve, burning the equivalent aTokens owned
*   `function borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf) external;`
    *   Allows users to borrow a specific `amount` of the reserve underlying asset, provided that the borrower already deposited enough collateral
    *   Mints an equivalent `amount` of stable/variable debt tokens depending upon `interestRateMode`
*   `function repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 rateMode, address onBehalfOf) external returns (uint256);`
    *   Repays a borrowed `amount` on a specific reserve, burning the equivalent debt tokens owned
*   `function setUserUseReserveAsCollateral(address asset, bool useAsCollateral) external;`
    *   Allows depositors to enable/disable a specific deposited asset as collateral


#### ProtocolDataProvider



*   `function getReserveTokensAddresses(address asset)`
    *   Returns the aToken and variableDebtToken addresses associated with `asset`


#### AToken

Minted and burned upon `deposit` and `withdraw` on LendingPool. 

Value is pegged to the value of the corresponding deposited asset at a 1:1 ratio.



*   `function balanceOf()`
    *   Returns the latest collateral balance (principal + interest).
*   `function UNDERLYING_ASSET_ADDRESS() returns (address)`
    *   Returns the underlying asset of the aToken
*   `function POOL() returns (address)`
    *   Returns the address of associated LendingPool for the aToken

Example: [aWETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x030bA81f1c18d280636F32af80b9AAd02Cf0854e)


#### VariableDebtToken

Minted and burned upon `borrow` and `repay` on LendingPool.

Represent a debt to the protocol with a variable interest rate.

**Non-transferrable tokens.**



*   `function balanceOf() `
    *   Returns the most up to date accumulated debt of the user.
*   `function UNDERLYING_ASSET_ADDRESS()`
*   `function POOL()`

Example: [Variable debt USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x619beb58998eD2278e08620f97007e1116D5D25b#balances)

#### Do these differences affect how often and where we call sync? Do we need to sync balances more/less often in ALM?



*   What does the sync function do?
    *   It keeps the SetToken position units in sync with the lending protocol balances.
*   When do we call the sync function?
    *   In CLM, we call the sync function
        *   Before Issuance
        *   Before redemption
        *   Before exiting markets
*   What happens when we do not call the sync function before issuance/redemption?
    *   Case 1: When notional SetToken positions are greater than balances on lending protocol
        *   This case might occur after a partial liquidation of the SetToken
        *   Example in case of Aave when ETH price is 200$ and target leverage is 2x
            *   1 aETH = 1 ETH = 200 USDC = 200 variableDebtUSDC
            *   Notional SetToken positions : (1 aETH, 100 variableDebtUSDC)
            *   Actual balance of SetToken : (0.8 aETH, 80 variableDebtUSDC) 
        *   Issuer pays a premium to issue the SetToken, SetToken becomes overcollateralized after issuance
        *   Redeemer receives a discount on redeeming the SetToken, while SetToken becomes undercollateralized after redemption
    *   Case 2: When notional SetToken positions is lesser than balances on lending protocol
        *   This case happens as interests accrue on both the collateral and debt
        *   This case wasnâ€™t possible in CLM, as the cToken balances in the SetToken always remained constant
        *   Example in case of Aave
            *   Notional SetToken positions : (1 aETH, 100 variableDebtUSDC)
            *   Actual balances of SetToken: (1.2 aETH, 120 variableDebtUSDC)
        *   Issuer receives a discount, SetToken becomes undercollateralized
        *   Redeemer pays a premium, SetToken becomes overcollateralized
*   Using above analysis, we can conclude that
    *   Frequency of calling sync function doesn't depend upon the interest accrual mechanism
    *   It is not about how often, but when we call sync function that matters
    *   It must be called at the right places, which is before issuance and redemption and also before exiting markets


#### Do these differences have an impact on different flows like issuance and redemption?



*   Issuance flow handles replicating the current debt position by borrowing assets from the Lending protocol, while redemption handles paying back the debt. 
*   Issuance and redemption flows would work correctly provided the sync function is called before each issuance and redemption.
    *   In Compound we only synced the debt positions, as the number of cTokens remained constant.
    *   In Aave, we would need to sync both collateral and debt positions.
*   We can use our current DebtIssuanceModule along with the new ALM.
    *   DebtIssuanceModule flows are Lending protocol agnostic.
    *   The borrowing and repayment parts of the flows are handled entirely by the associated Leverage Module, which is triggered by the issue/redeem hooks.


#### Do these differences in interest accrual mechanisms affect the number of arbitrage opportunities available?



*   Arbitrage opportunities arise due to difference in notional value of the SetToken and price of the SetToken on DEXes
    *   Value of a SetToken (in USDC) = `(collateral amount * collateral price in USDC on DEX - debt amount * debt price in USDC on DEX) / totalSupply`, (amount = principal + interest)
    *   Interest accrual mechanism affects the rate at which collateral and debt amounts update in the above equation, while other factors are decided entirely by the market
*   Aave updates the collateral and debt amounts at a higher rate (every block), compared to Compound, which updates amounts only when the corresponding market is invoked
*   But off-chain bots can calculate the exact collateral and debt amounts for every block, for both Compound and Aave.
    *   And off-chain bots can invoke the corresponding compound market to accrue interest and update the collateral and debt amounts. They can do it every block, if itâ€™s in their favor. 
    *   Thus the difference in update rate is of no significance to off-chain arbitrage bots.
*   Hence differences between interest accrual mechanisms doesnâ€™t affect the number of arbitrage opportunities available.


#### Does Aave using Chainlink oracles increase the volatility decay of products based on ALM?


*   Volatility decay in leveraged ETFs is proportional to the choppiness of the price of underlying assets
*   Chainlink oracles have a higher granular price feed thus increasing the choppiness of the on-chain price of the underlying asset
*   With livelier oracles, If the leverage exceeds the max or min bounds, it would trigger a rebalance
*   Keeping other things equal, this leads to products with higher volatility decay

## Open Questions



*   Allow a Set to have multiple leverage positions on Aave (similar to CLM)? I.e. leverage ETH with USDC as collateral and leverage WBTC with DAI as collateral in the same SetToken
    *   Yes
*   Do we incorporate Aave flash loans directly into the AaveLeverageModule?
    *   No, max LTV is not as big of a limiting factor as max trade size, punt on flashloans for now
*   Should the AaveLeverageModule work for recursive leverage?
*   Do we want to have a protocol fee that we can turn on for trade() the same as TradeModule?
    *   Yes


## Feasibility Analysis

**Option 1**: GeneralLeverageModule (GLM) and LendingProtocolAdapters



*   GLM would be a protocol agnostic module
*   It would be extended by LendingProtocolAdapters
*   LendingProtocolAdapters are protocol specific contracts which encapsulate all interactions with a given Lending protocol
*   LendingProtocolAdapters allow the GLM to interact with various current lending protocols
    *   There are 6 lending protocols with TVL > 1B and 13 protocols with TVL > 100M (Source: [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/))
*   Allows supporting new lending protocols relatively easier compared to writing a new module for each lending protocol
*   Reduces development effort required by third party protocols, building on top of Set Protocol, to support lending protocols of their choice
*   Implementation would involve taking functionalities from the Compound Leverage Module and dividing them into two buckets, protocol agnostic (GLM) and protocol `dependent (LendingProtocolAdapter)
*   LendingProtocolAdapter would return calldata for different interactions with the external protocol, which can then be invoked on the SetToken.
*   Functions in LendingProtocolAdapter
    *   deposit
    *   withdraw
    *   borrow
    *   repay
    *   updateCollateralAsset
    *   updateBorrowAsset
    *   getCollateralPosition
    *   getBorrowPosition
*   Functions in GLM

*   High initial design and development cost
*   Need further analysis on
    *   If we would support other lending protocols in the future (apart from Compound and Aave) 
    *   if it is a requirement for third party protocols building on top of Set Protocol
*   Off-chain workers would need to be updated to work with Aave, as small changes in interface might be introduced

**Option 2**: AaveLeverageModule (similar pattern to CompoundLeverageModule)



*   Similar to CLM:
    *   Parts of the protocol agnostic code can be directly imported from CLM
    *   An external library that houses all the Aave external interactions
    *   Allow for multiple positions and potentially open it to 3rd party managers
*   Low initial development cost
*   External interface would be exactly similar to CLM
    *   Allows us to use existing FlexibleLeverageStrategyAdapter contract along with the new ALM
        *   Existing FlexibleLeverageStrategyAdapter uses `collateralBalance = collateralToken.balanceOf(setToken) * exchangeRate`, which is specific to Compound, and would need to be updated to just `collateralBalance = collateralToken.balanceOf(setToken)` to work with Aave
        *   Both FlexibleLeverageStrategyAdapter and Aave will use chainlink price feeds. Increases security and efficiency of products based on ALM, compared to CLM.
    *   Existing off-chain infrastructure can be used to support new ALM
    
*   Will need to write a new module for every lending protocol that we support in future (if any)

**Why should we go ahead with Option 2?**

Option 2 has a moderate initial development cost but allows us to tap into 19 Billion dollars worth of liquidity on Aave across all itâ€™s markets. Time is a major factor in a bull run, and it is in our favor to enable leverage products quickly without compromising the security of our products. The CLM is a tried and tested design and replicating that to work with Aave is the most optimal implementation considering both security and time. Implementing an Aave Leverage Module also increases our understanding of how a General Leverage Module (Option 1) would look like, if we develop one in future. 

Note: We havenâ€™t discussed collecting stAAVE LM rewards in this STIP, as that would be specced out in another STIP.
